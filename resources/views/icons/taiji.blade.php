<!--

-- nothing is ever fully yin or yang (dots)
-- when one is at its widest, the other appears
-- sickness are seen as yin/yang being out of balance
-- seeing thing as good or bad is itself a demonstration of you or the society you live in being out of balance
-- maybe favoring one element over the other
